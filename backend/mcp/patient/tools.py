Domain logic for MCP tools used by the patient server.

This module isolates core functionality so that it can be imported by
`server.py` (or unit-tests) without coupling the logic to the FastMCP server
instance.  Each function here is **pure business logic** â€” registration with
FastMCP happens in `server.py`.
